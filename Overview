# Azure Security and Compliance Blueprint: Analytics for FedRAMP Automation

## Overview

The [Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)](https://www.fedramp.gov/) is a United States government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. This Azure Security and Compliance Blueprint provides guidance for how to deliver a Microsoft Azure analytics architecture that helps implement a subset of FedRAMP High controls. This solution provides guidance on the deployment and configuration of Azure resources for a common reference architecture, demonstrating ways in which customers can meet specific security and compliance requirements and serves as a foundation for customers to build and configure their own analytics solutions in Azure.

This reference architecture, associated control implementation guides, and threat models are intended to serve as a foundation for customers to adjust to their specific requirements and should not be used as-is in a production environment. Deploying an application into this environment without modification is insufficient to completely meet the requirements of the FedRAMP High baseline. Please note the following:
- The architecture provides a baseline to help customers deploy workloads to Azure in a FedRAMP-compliant manner.
- Customers are responsible for conducting appropriate security and compliance assessments of any solution built using this architecture, as requirements may vary based on the specifics of each customer's implementation.






## Compliance Documentation
The [Azure Security and Compliance Blueprint – FedRAMP High Customer Responsibility Matrix](https://aka.ms/blueprinthighcrm) lists all security controls required by the FedRAMP High baseline. Similarly, the [Azure Security and Compliance Blueprint – FedRAMP Moderate Customer Responsibility Matrix](https://aka.ms/blueprintcrmmod) lists all security controls required by the FedRAMP Moderate baseline. Both documents detail whether the implementation of each control is the responsibility of Microsoft, the customer, or shared between the two.

The [Azure Security and Compliance Blueprint - FedRAMP High Control Implementation Matrix](https://aka.ms/blueprintdwcimhigh) and the [Azure Security and Compliance Blueprint - FedRAMP Moderate Control Implementation Matrix](https://aka.ms/blueprintdwcimmod) provide information on which controls are covered by the data warehouse architecture for each FedRAMP baseline, including detailed descriptions of how the implementation meets the requirements of each covered control.
